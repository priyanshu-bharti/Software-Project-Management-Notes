## What is Change Management?

- Transition from existing state of the project to another state is change management.
- When a project undergoes changes, these processes happen:
  1. Requesting a change.
  2. Evaluating change request.
  3. Creating a change proposal.
  4. Planning the change.
  5. Implementing changes.
  6. Testing the change.
  7. Reviewing performance after changes.
  8. Closing the change process.

## Why Change management is necessary?

- Improve Performance
- Add New features
- Introducing Innovation
- Reducing Costs
- Increasing customer engagement
- Adapting project to current market needs

## Sources of change

- Corporate Reorganization
- Change in market
- New and better tools available
- Change in customer needs
- Fixing Bugs
- Budget or Schedule changes
- Optimizations

## What are Project Contracts

- An agreement between the ones making the project and the client.
- Formal agreement to obtain services required for the development of agreed project.
- Contracts can differ based on the kind of software we're dealing with.

## Managing contracts

## Types of contracts

-

### Fixed Price Contracts

- Advantageous to the client
- Client knows the expenditure to be expected.
- Developer has to be cost effective.
- The developer may increase the cost due to risks and uncertainties.
- Makes difficult to modify the software later on.
- Might be a downside to overall software quality.

### Time and Materials Contracts

- Easy to change the requirements
- Lack of pressure facilitates software quality.
- Customer is responsible for changing requirements.
- Developer doesn't have incentive to be cost effective.

### Fixed Price per Delivered Unit Contracts

- Customer has detailed information about the calculation of the price.
- Comparability between different pricing.
- New functionality can be considered.
- Developer has incentive to be cost effective.
- Difficulties with size measurement.

## Tendering Process

### Open Tendering

- Any developer can bid their offer to make software.
- All tenders must be evaluated equally.

### Restricted Tendering

- Only the ones with invite can bid.
- Reduces the developer being considered at any stage.

### Negotiated Tendering

- There is only one developer making the project.

## Stages in contracting

1. Requirement Analysis
2. Evaluation Plan
3. Invitation to contractor
4. Evaluation of bids

## Requirement Specification Document

- Gives an idea about the overall structure of the project
- Lists the purpose and the intentions behind the functionality of the project.
- Forms a basis of agreement between the client and the developer.
- Acts as a basis for review and evaluation.

### Format of the SRS document

1. Introduction to the project
2. Description of the existing system and implementation
3. Future strategy or plans
4. System Requirements
5. Desired features to be added.
6. Deadlines
7. Additional Information required from the bidders.

## Memoranda of agreement

- Describes a cooperative relationship between the client and the developer.
- Specifies that both parties are working to achieve an agreed goal.
- It serves as a legal document and describes the details of the partnership agreement.
- Technical proposals are examined using MoA. 

## What should be included in the contract?
1. Technical Definitions
2. Form of Agreement
3. Goods and Services supplied
4. Timetable of activities
5. Payment Modes
6. Software Ownership
7. Environment
8. Client Commitments
9. Standards to be met
