# Module 2

### Planning the Project

1.  Identify Scope, Objectives and authority
2.  Analyse Project Planning, Infrastructure and Standards
3.  Determine project type and SDLC.
4.  Identify the activities and deliverables
5.  Estimate effort and resources required
6.  Identify risks
7.  Allocate Resources
8.  Review project plan + prepare documentation
9.  Execute the plan
10. Create Low-level plans

### Project Evaluation



### Strategic Assessment

* Assess whether project coincides with goals of the organization?
* Done by senior management

### Project Evaluation

* It is based on the following factors :
    * Technical Feasibility (Hardware and software)
    * Cost balancing (How finances can be managed)
    * Benefits from the project (How the stakeholders could benefit)
    * Degree of risks (What issues are associated with the project)

### Cost benefit Analysis

* Identify costs and benefits of the project and its deliverables.
* Costs include :
    1. Development Costs
    2. Setup Costs
    3. Operating Costs

### Cash-flow Processing

* Estimating the cost and benefit of the project
* Predicting cash flow that could take place
* `Net Profit` : Total cost - total income
* `Payback Period` : Time taken to pay back the initial investment
* `Return on Investment` : A.k.a. Accounting Rate of Return

### Return on investment

* `ROI` = ((Avg Annual Profit) / Total Investment) \* 100

### Discount Factor

* `Discount Factor` = 1/(1+r)^t

## Software Estimating techniques

### Algorithmic Models

* Predicts the effort needed
* Basis :
    * Details of the target system
    * Implementation techniques

### Expert Judgement

* Advice of the expert is considered.

### Analogy

* Similar completed project is analysed and effort is estimated according to it.

### Parkinson

* Identifies who is available and use that as an estimate.

### Price to Win

* Estimate is the lowest to win a contract.

### Top-Down

* Overall Estimate calculated based on breaking down the project into parts.

### Bottom-up

* Smaller components are considered and the costs are aggregated.

### Top down vs Bottom Up

### `Bottom up`

* Use when no past data is available
* Time consuming since you need to identify all tasks to be done.

### `Top-Down`

* Based on past data
* Divide

### COCOMO

* Constructive Cost Model
* Based on lines of Code
* Regression Model
* Procedural Cost Estimation Model

## Introduction

* `PM-BOK` : Project management body of knowledge.
* `Risk` : Uncertain condition which if occurs might have an adverse effect on the project.

### Risk

* It relates to uncertain future
* Causes for risk :
    * Untrained Staffing
    * Poor Specifications
    * Inaccurate Estimation of effort
* Effects :
    * Cost Overrun
    * Low Productivity

### Risk Categories

1. **`Schedule Risk`**

* Time related risks
* Affects the development time and delivery
* Reasons :
    * Time is not estimated perfectly
    * Improper resource allocation
    * Tracking of resources like system, skill, staff etc
    * Frequent project scope expansion
    * Failure in function identification and itsâ€™ completion

2. **`Budget Risk`**

* Due to overspending the budget
* Improper finance distribution.
* Reasons :
    * Wrong/Improper budget estimation
    * Unexpected Project Scope expansion
    * Mismanagement in budget handling
    * Cost overruns
    * Improper tracking of Budget

3. **`Operational Risk`**

* Happen in day-to-day operational activities due to improper process implementation or some external operational risks.
* Reasons :
    * Insufficient resources
    * Conflict between tasks and employees
    * Improper management of tasks
    * No proper planning about project
    * Less number of skilled people
    * Lack of communication and cooperation
    * Lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities
    * Insufficient training

4. `Technical Risk`

* Depends on the performance of the product
* Reasons :
    * Frequent changes in requirement
    * Less use of future technologies
    * Less number of skilled employee
    * High complexity in implementation
    * Improper integration of modules

5. `Programmatic Risk`

* External or unavoidable risks
* Reasons :
    * Rapid development of market
    * Running out of fund / Limited fund for project development
    * Changes in Government rules/policy
    * Loss of contracts due to any reason
