## Project Definition

- Plan or design of a Software
- Taking the software from a prototype design to the actual working product.
- Projects involve exploration and a set of activites for development of the software.

## Characteristics of Projects

The Software Projects contain the following characteristics:

- Plan
- Budget
- Start and End Date
- Set of repeating and non-repeating tasks
- Involves specializations
- Phases of development
- Constraint on resources
- Complex architecture

## Types of Project

**Walking in the fog**

- Don’t know what you want or how to achieve it
- Organisation is attempting to do something different.
- Something that hasn’t been attempted before.
- These types of projects are started because of a change in circumstances.
- Changes can be political, legislative, or socio-economic organisational change.
- Walking in the fog projects should proceed cautiously.
- If not, you risk delivering nothing of benefit to the organisation.

**Making a movie**

- You know how to do but not what to do.
- Stakeholders know how project should go but what should be done.
- You need expertise in the area of interest and the workforce to do the project.
- Take care of the what questions early on rather than how.
- Get the problem solvers and task them of solving 'what'.
- Once the what is resolved, you can quickly finish things off.

**Going on a quest**

- You are very sure of what should be done yet, unsure how you will achieve it.
- IT projects generally fall in this category.
- Budget is usually overblown, Project is late, or not delivering the expected benefits.
- You need to balance time and cost with the freedom to innovate and solve problems.

**Painting by numbers**

- You always want to be under time you start investing lots of time and money.
- You are sure of what to do and how it is to be done.
- Have clear goals and set of activities to complete the project.

## Problems with Developing Software Project

- Projects are not often successful
  - Only 1/3rd of the projects are successful
  - 82% were delayed
  - 43% exceeded the budget
- Poor Management and Lack of skills
- Poor Risk management
- Poor delegation of responsibilities
- Undefined Success benchmark
- Lack of updated documentation
- Lack of standards

## Activities covered by Software Project Management

1. `Requirements` Requirement Analysis
1. `Requirements` Feasibility Check
1. `Design` System Design analysis
1. `Design` Create visual representation
1. `Implementation` Detailed Design
1. `Implementation` Code and Text
1. `Implementation` Integration
1. `Implementation` Qualification Test
1. `Installation` Installation
1. `Installation` Acceptance Support

## Plans and Methodologies for testing software projects

- Analyse Requirements
- Derive and Write Test Cases
- Verify that Requirements are implemented
- Create scripts that checks for each output of the test cases.
- Compare the actual and expected for each test case.

## Management in a Nutshell

- **Planning** : Decide what is to be done.
- **Organizing** : Make arrangements.
- **Staffing** : Selecting the right people for the job.
- **Directing** : Give instructions.
- **Monitoring** : Checking on progress.
- **Controlling** : Actions that gets you out of stuck situation.
- **Innovating** : Coming up with unique solutions.
- **Representing** : Communicate with stakeholders.

## Objective of the Project

- **Specific** : Concise and concrete information
- **Measurable** : Existence of some metric for evaluating progress/success.
- **Achievable** : By the group or the individual.
- **Relevant** : To the purpose of the project.
- **Time Constrained** : Definite point in time by which the project has to be done.

## Objectives from different perspectives

- **Overall** : User Satisfaction.
- **Analyst** : Accurate Requirements Specified.
- **Developer** : Software must be reliable.

## Stakeholders

- People who have interest in the project.
- **Internal Stakeholders** : Under the direct managerial control of the project leader.
- **External Stakeholders** : Within the organization but in a different team.
- **External to Projects and Organization** : Users, clients, freelance contractors, etc.

## Software Project Management Control Cycle

### Control Cycle

1. Determine Information Source from the Real World
2. Collect data
3. Process the data
4. Define objectives
5. Make decisions based on the insights
6. Model the plans and probable outcomes
7. Implement the changes or features to the project
8. Take necessary actions.
