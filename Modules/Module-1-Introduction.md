# Software Project Manangement

## Module - 1 : Introduction to Software Project Management

### Curriculum

- Project Definition
- Types of Project
- Problem with Software Project
- Activities covered By Software Project Management
- Management Control Cycle.

### What is a project?

- Set of unique tasks.
- Tasks can be completed in order to achieve a desired outcome.
- Each project has it own life cycle.
- There are clearly defined start and end points.

### What is Software Project management?

- To meet project requirements, we applying
  - knowledge,
  - skills
  - tools and techniques
- Achieve a desired outcome by using a combination of skills like
  - Strategic Thinking
  - Time management and Organization.

### Why is software project management important?

- Poor project management can lead to:
  - Money and budget limitations (43% projects go over-budget)
  - Software projects aren’t usually successful (33% success rate)
  - Unexpected delays (82% projects were late)

### Project Characteristics

- Requires Planning
- Has a Specific and clear goal
- Non-routine tasks involved
- Made for a customer
- Involves different specializations
- Made in several phases
- The task is rather complex
- Has limited resources

### What makes Software projects different from other projects?

- Invisibility (We don’t see the software until it is ready)
- Complexity (Software design by nature is complex to understand)
- Conformity (Abide by the requirements of the human clients)
- Flexibility (Once a project is completed the deliverables can be tweaked)

### Activities covered by software project management

1. **Feasibility study**
   - Gather information about the requirements of proposed software
   - Ask clients and stakeholders what problem they wish to overcome.
2. **Planning**
   - If the project seem viable, planning begins.
   - In case of large projects, the detailed projects are not right at beginning.
   - Create outline for entire project and detailed for the first stage.
3. **Execution**
   - Consists of design and implementation sub-phases
   - Design is about thinking and making decision about the precise form the products that the project is to create.
   - The plan lays down the activities that have to be carried out in order to create the products.

### Software Development Phases

1. **Project Initiation**
   1. Define scope of the project
   2. Understand the domain
   3. Understand the problem
2. **Requirement/Planning**
   1. Analyze the project requirements
   2. Perform feasibility check
   3. Prepare the SRS documentation
   4. Send the documentation to the client for its approval
3. **Design**
   1. Define the project’s architectural design
   2. Prepare various UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagrams
      - Use-case Diagram
      - Data Flow diagram
      - Activity diagram
      - State Diagram
      - Class and Object Diagrams
   3. Perform Project Design Review
4. **Development**
   1. Prepare the prototype for the client
   2. Start the project implementation based on the design and requirements
   3. Conduct Code reviews with experts
5. **Testing**
   1. Perform different kinds of testing
      - Black Box
      - Grey Box
      - White Box
      - Code and branch Coverage
      - Load and stress testing
      - Usability testing
   2. Remove any bugs and issues plaguing the project
   3. Prepare a testing summary/report for the project
6. **Deployment**
   1. Prepare the instruction and operation manual for the client
   2. Install the project on the client’s systems
   3. Perform Operational Acceptance
   4. Prepare the acceptance document
7. **Post-Deployment**
   1. Initially, the project is released with less functionality, which get added overtime.
   2. Prepare the post installation notice document.
   3. Periodically update the software and provide support.

### SDLC As Per ISO 12207

- **Requirement Analysis:**
  - Investigate potential users and what their requirements for the project.
  - Perform Quality refinements
- **Architecture Design:**
  - Create a low level design of the system based on the requirements.
  - Then create a high level design that maps the software requirements to the actual components.
- **Detailed Design:**
  - Each software component is designed and tested in isolation.
- **Coding and Testing:**
  - Write the code to implement the designs using some programming language.
- **Integration:**
  - Components collected together and tested to see if they fulfill the requirements.
  - Software components can be combined together at the system level.
- **Qualification Testing:**
  - See if the system satisfies all the requirements that was specified in the specification.
- **Installation:**
  - Deploy the system and make it operational for the client.
  - May also require setting up the system parameters, installing the system onto the hardware platforms and training the users.
- **Acceptance Support:**
  - Resolve all the problems with the new system
  - Debug and fix the code if there are any problems.
  - Implement any improvements if requrired.

### Plan vs Methods vs Methodologies

- **Plans** : Some idea about the method of working on completing a process.
- **Methods** : Type of activity to be performed in general.
- **Methodologies** : Group of several techniques or methods to be performed.

### What is management?

- It involves the following activities such as :
  1. **Planning :** Decide What to do
  2. **Organizing :** Make arrangements
  3. **Staffing :** Recruiting right people
  4. **Directing :** Delegating tasks and instructing them
  5. **Monitoring :** Track the progress
  6. **Controlling :** Take actions when stuck
  7. **Innovating :** Coming up with problem’s solutions
  8. **Representing :** Communicating with the clients, stakeholders and developers.

### Problems with software projects

- Poor planning and resource estimation
- Lack of standards and measures to be followed
- Lack of guidelines to make informed decisions
- Lack of methods to visualize the progress
- Ambiguity in roles and responsibilities
- Incorrect success benchmark
- Lack of up-to-date documentation

### Goals from the perspective of different stakeholders

- **Objective:** User satisfaction with software product
- **Analyst Goals:** Accurate Requirements
- **Developer Goals:** Software should be reliable

### Project Objectives

- They’re the reasons for the completion and success of the project.
- It focuses on **what** to be done rather than **how** things would be done.
- Project needs to have an authority
  - To setup the scope
  - To approve the budget
  - To Setup and monitor the objectives
  - To update objectives as they see fit
  - Authority could be:
    - Board Members
    - Management Board
    - Steering Committee

### Objective Characteristics (SMART)

- **Specific** : Effective, clear and well defined.
- **Measurable** : Measure of how successful the project has been.
- **Achievable** : By the team or the individual
- **Relevant** : Objective must be relevant to the project
- **Time Constrained** : Definite point in time by which the project should be completed.

### Who are Stakeholders?

- People who have some stake or interest in the project
- They could be:
  - users
  - clients
  - developers
  - internal members
  - external members within the organization. (Ex Project Manager)
  - External members outside the organization. (Independent Contractors)

### Projects from a business standpoint

- The benefits must outweigh the costs
- **Costs :**
  - Development Cost
  - Operational Cost
- **Benefits :**
  - Quantifiable
  - Non-Quantifiable

### Management Control

![Management Control](https://miro.medium.com/max/1132/1*_ERyhe1CUCCerIl0YHGwLw.png)

1. Determine source of information from the Real World
2. Collect data
3. Process the data
4. Define objectives
5. Make decisions based on the insights
6. Model the plans and probable outcomes
7. Implement the changes or features to the project
8. Take necessary actions.
